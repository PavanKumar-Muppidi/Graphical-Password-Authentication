# Graphical Password Authentication System

## Overview
This project implements a **Graphical Password Authentication System** using a combination of HTML, CSS, Java, and Python. It allows users to authenticate by selecting a sequence of images or specific regions on an image. This system aims to offer a secure alternative to text-based passwords.

## Features
- User registration and login using graphical passwords.
- JSP-based web interface.
- Secure password storage using image-based sequences.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Apache Tomcat (for JSP execution)
- Python 3.x (for backend logic)

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PavanKumar-Muppidi/Graphical-Password-Authentication.git
   ```

2. Set up the environment:
   - Install necessary dependencies.
   - Deploy the project on Tomcat.

3. Run the application:
   - Access the web interface via `localhost` using your browser.
